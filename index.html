			Hello everyone, my name is Ludovico eventhough most of my friend use to call Ludo. I was born and raised in Geneva and i'm 22 years old. Currently i'm doing my last semester (BOSC6) at EHL where I SHOULD graduate in February if nothing goes wrong ! I'm a huge golf enthusiast but also a big skier. I love doing sport.

		<h1>My passion</h1>
		<p>
			Cooking: A passion for cooking is an endless exploration of flavors, techniques and creativity. It's the art of blending ingredients and spices to create delicious dishes, from bold experimentation to the perfection of classic recipes. It's also about sharing convivial moments and the pleasure of satisfying the taste buds of those who savor it. Cooking is a culinary adventure that never ends.

		<h1>Sports</h1>
		<ul> Golf, skiing and tennis are my unshakeable sporting passions. Golf attracts me with its combination of skill and strategy, with every shot a challenge. Skiing, on the other hand, offers a mountain adventure, a sense of freedom and adrenalin as you hurtle down snow-covered slopes. Finally, tennis is a blend of competition and elegance, where technique and tactics come together for thrilling exchanges. These sports embody my passion for physical activity, nature and competition, each bringing a unique dimension to my life.</ul>
